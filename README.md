I really really really really really need to learn JAVASCRIPT

**Why ?**
It's something that I use every single day but still is completly something that I don't know... at all... beside declaring variable ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

**Day 01**
I know the very basics

- Declaring vars and each types of it
- Basic functions
- Touched some ForEach for loops
